    OOPL-Clinic a system that can display the patient's general info, record of their consultation, and sort them. It also possible to: mark the patient if their consultation is done, and add new patient or delete them.

## Specipication

    1. Can display patient's information. (NAME, AGE, GENDER, ADDRESS).
    2. System can mark the patient if it is done with his/her consultation.
    3. System can add and delete patient.
    4. System can arrange the patient's record.

    There is no add consultation in the instruction so i just provided data directly ito flat file.
    Sorting of Time is Desc because you wan't the latest record.
    

## Constraints

    Basic only for frontend and backend (like: 2 same user can't exist).
    Patient name can accept both string and int because there are some cases their names can't be disclosed, so we use Patient no. code name, etc. (Major reason is we are not using database).
